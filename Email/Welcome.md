Welcome MA 15300 Students!

I am Gage Sorrell, the instructor for MA 15300-02, College Algebra.  In two days, we will have our first lecture.

I have attached a copy of the syllabus, and the notes for our first lecture.

This first lecture will be a bit different from the rest.  We are going to *introduce* a lot of content, without delving fully into it.  The notes themselves will contain full descriptions, and will serve as a reference (or glossary) of sorts for us to look at more rigorously later in the course.

Don't panic when you see content in these notes that feels completely new to you; we just want to get the gist of the content (for now).

Before our lecture on Tuesday, your obligations are just to read the syllabus, and skim through the Day 1 notes.

I am excited to meet you all on Tuesday.  Please email me with any questions at sorrgs01@pfw.edu (I am sending this via BrightSpace, so I am unsure where your email will go if you hit "Reply" for this email).

Thank you!
Gage
